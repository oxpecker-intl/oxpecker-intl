### Check out my Tools & Snippets section....
see some practical tools, code snippets and SN configurations that I use in real SN work and client projects:

##### Tools
- **Postman** – Preconfigured collections for ServiceNow API, MID Server auth, and REST testing
- **ServiceNow CLI** – Custom command-line utilities for fast sys_id lookups, imports, and table exports
- **VSCode Setup** – My preferred extensions and settings for scoped app development
- **UIPath Studio** – Designing unattended automations triggered via ServiceNow or webhooks
- **Zapier / Pipedream** – Lightweight automation prototypes and quick SaaS integrations

##### Snippets
- `business-rule-template.js` – Guarded scoped business rule with change detection
- `scripted-rest-api.js` – Scaffold for ServiceNow custom REST endpoints
- `transform-map-script.js` – Logic to clean and normalize imported customer data
- `flow-designer-step.js` – Reusable script for Flow Designer steps
- `uipath-trigger.json` – Sample payload to start a robot via UIPath Orchestrator API
